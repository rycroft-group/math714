# Elliptic equations examples

This directory contains several introductory examples used in Lectures 4 and 5 on elliptic equations.

## The `d_elliptic.ipynb` notebook

The Python notebook contains the same code and functionality as the four `.py` files below. It combines the scripts into an interactive format, making it easier to run, visualize results, and make modifications directly within the notebook environment. 

## The `poisson.py` example

The **poisson.py** showcases how to solve a 2D Poisson problem with the 5-point Laplacian stencil. The program can be run by typing the following command in the
terminal:

```Shell
python3 poisson.py
```

The program visualizes the solution in a 3D surface plot.
