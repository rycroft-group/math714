# Hyperbolic equations examples

This directory contains several introductory examples used in Lectures 13, 14, and 15 on hyperbolic equations.

## The `hyperbolic.ipynb` notebook

The Python notebook contains the same code and functionality in the Python scripts below. It combines the scripts into an interactive format, making it easier to run, visualize results, and make modifications directly within the notebook environment. 

## The `transp.py` example

The program `transp.py` solves the linear advection equation using the upwinding method. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 transp.py
```

## The `transp2.py` example

The program `transp2.py` solves the linear advection equation using the central difference method, which will diverge, albeit slowly. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 transp2.py
```
