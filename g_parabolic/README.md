# Iterative methods examples

This directory contains several introductory examples used in Lectures 6 and 7 on iterative methods.

## The `parabolic.ipynb` notebook

The Python notebook contains the same code and functionality in the Python scripts below. It combines the scripts into an interactive format, making it easier to run, visualize results, and make modifications directly within the notebook environment. 

## The `heat.py` example

The program `heat.py` solves the heat equation on a periodic unit interval using an
explicit finite difference scheme. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 heat.py
```

## The `c-n.py` example

The program `c-n.py` solves the heat equation using the Crank-Nicolson method, which is second-order in space and time, and unconditionally stable. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 c-n.py
```
