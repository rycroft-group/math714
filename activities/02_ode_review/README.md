# Math/CS 714 - ODE review workshop
This directory contains files from the ODE review workshop. They demonstrate how to use Python to solve ODE initial value problems (IVPs).

- **e_stab.py** - Euler method for $dy/dt=-\lambda y$ while checking for stability.

- **euler.py** - Euler method for $dy/dt=-\lambda y$.

- **l-v.py** - Model the predator–prey ODE model with the Lotka–Volterra equation.

- **nystrom.py** - Demonstrate how to set up the Nystrom method based on the Butcher tableau.

- **order2.py** - Demonstrate how to set up second-order methods: improved Euler, Heun's, and Ralston's method.

The Python notebook contains the same code and functionality as the five `.py` files above. It combines the scripts into an interactive format, making it easier to run, visualize results, and make modifications directly within the notebook environment.
